# Who this is for?
These instructions should hopefully allow anyone motivated enough to build a trophy truck from scratch. 

It won't be cheap. It also won't be nearly as prohibitively expensive as an arrive and drive program. You can get shockingly far with a grinder and a welder, but the recent drop in pricing for various tools allows us to create better quality products, faster. This guide guide will hopefully solve many of the workflow problems letting you move through various steps quickly on my designs or use them as inspiration for your own creation. 

# Inital setup

# Fixture Table
Your truck will only be as precise as the tools you use to build it. For this reason I am a huge fan of fixture tables. In my mind, there are two main options:

1) Professional table. These will get you fabricating the fastest but you pay a premium.
2) DIY. There are multiple vendors selling the CAD files for plasma tables. My two favorites are Viny B and Maker Table. Doing this step yourself can put multiple thousands back into your race budget.

The fixtures I included are 5/8 inch on a 4 inch grid. Any table with those dimensions should work although you will need to make sure the table is flat, otherwise your chassis will inherit and warp the table has. 

You could probably CAD your own fixture table, but the time involved quickly offsets the small amount Viny B/Maker Table charges for the files so I don't think its worth it. 

# Making your fixtures
The fixtures have been designed to tab and slot together. It should only require minimal welds to hold each piece together, and extra welding will increase the chances of the tube warping, so be sparing and weld in the provided locations whenever possible. 

# Chasis Fab
I am working off the assumption you are using a Chevy silverado 2500 HD as a donor car that is roughly a 2005 model year.


# Cutting your tubes
There are many companies that will happily cut your tubes for you. Cal West Manufacturing in particular has a good reputaion and reasonable prices. 

If you choose to go down the route of cutting the tubes in house, you can either use a rotary axis on a plasma table or a dedicated tube notcher. My personal opion is that the dedicated tube notcher shines with really long tubes but the plasma table excels everywhere else, especially because you will want the plasma table for creating your fixtures.

I have designed a DIY plasma tube notcher with a BOM on ~2,000 usd, but I personally believe your time would be better spent elsewhere unless you intend to commercialize your chasis fab work. 

# Suspension

Entire books can and have been written on the subject of suspension. 

The included BOM and fixtures will get a set of working parts, from there you are welcom to tweak and modify to your heats content.

# Powertrain
From the donor car we should have an LS motor, 4l80E transmission and a 14 bolt rear axle. None of these components are top of the line, but they are arguably the best bang for the buck components on the market right now.
